# CSharpAssignments
Assignments from the Udemy C# course I'm currently taking (beginner to intermediate)


The structure of this repository will be that separate methods will be created for 
each assignment, so to run any particular assignment invoke its method from the 
main() class. This is to minimize clutter, as the assignments are teeny tiny so far.

More involved assignments (projects?) may exist in their own repositories. Who knows.
It's a crazy world and anything can happen...
